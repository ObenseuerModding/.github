# Obenseuer Modding Github Community

This is the Obenseuer Github Community Repository. We have a selection of packages that have either been dedicated to the community or have permissive licenses and have been abandoned.

## How to Contribute

### As an External Contributor
Anyone can fork an existing github repository and submit changes as a pull request upstream, so simply follow the procedure for doing so against an existing project in the community repo to contribute.

### As an Internal Maintainer or Publisher

If you'd like to do _more_ for your community and you've already established yourself as a Modder then you may speak with any of the Org Members below to apply for greater permissions within the organization

### Suggesting a Mod for Adoption

If you know of a mod that needs fixing for the current game version and has been abandoned by its original author then get in contact with an Org Leader above and have it added to the Community Repo where you may fork and maintain it for the newest version. Only suggestions with a commitment to maintain will be considered, please do not suggest a mod if you are not willing to update it for the current game version.

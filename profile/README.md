# Obenseuer Modding GitHub Community

Welcome to the Obenseuer Modding GitHub Community Repository. Here, we host a collection of packages that have been either dedicated to our community or are under permissive licenses and have been left unmaintained.

## Our Goal

Our goal is to create a collaborative space for community-dedicated packages, allowing any member or external collaborator to contribute to the maintenance and development of mods for the game Obenseuer.

### Why is This Important?

While this may not seem crucial now, it will become increasingly important as Obenseuer gains traction on modding platforms like Nexusmods, Curse, or Thunderstore. Without a centralized system, maintaining another user's package can be challenging. Our team at the Modding GitHub has expertise in developing CI-based publishing scripts that enable multiple users to share responsibilities and publish under a unified namespace on Thunderstore. We aim to extend this capability to other platforms chosen by the community. This approach ensures continuity by allowing packages to retain their original names even when changing maintainers, minimizing disruptions and preventing users from having to search for replacement versions of outdated mods.

## How to Contribute

### As an External Contributor

Anyone can fork an existing GitHub repository and submit changes as a pull request upstream. Simply follow the procedure for doing so against an existing project in the community repo to contribute.

### As an Internal Maintainer or Publisher

If you'd like to do more for your community and you've already established yourself as a modder, you may speak with any of the Org Members below to apply for greater permissions within the organization:

- Robyn

### Suggesting a Mod for Adoption

If you know of a mod that needs fixing for the current game version and has been abandoned by its original author, get in contact with an Org Leader above to have it added to the Community Repo. You may then fork and maintain it for the newest version. Only suggestions with a commitment to maintain will be considered; please do not suggest a mod if you are not willing to update it for the current game version.

## Getting Started as a Modder

We have prepared several template repositories complete with instructions on how to use them to get started modding with either BepInEx (Recommended) or OSLoader (WIP)
